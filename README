Designed to scan networks specified in a config file, produce database mapping of IP, MAC, and a tiemstamp for when the scan ran. Single-threaded, so if you want, it can run continuously, to keep things up to date. Will dump the data into probably postgresql, but that's configurable.

Network.py
    Iterates on the addresses in its network
Host.py
    Does the actual scan
Crawl.py
    Runs the system in a loop
Check.py
    Externally callable program to do a lookup on an IP or range
